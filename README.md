Source code for the Bundestag Petitionen Bot on <a rel="me" href="https://troet.cafe/@bundestagpetitionen10k">Mastodon</a>.

The `mastodon_bot.py` runs once per day on a server to fetch the current petitions ordered by the amount of supporters. 
If a petition has more than 10k supporters and if it was not already posted, it will be posted on mastodon once.
